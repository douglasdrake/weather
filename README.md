# weather

# Description
Provide a visualization dashboard for meteorological data generated in the repo
[WeatherData](https://github.com/douglasdrake/WeatherData).  Meteorological data was queried for 
over 500 cities from the OpenWeatherMap API.  These data were then plotted using matplotlib and 
seaborn.

# Methods
1.  HTML.  The layout of each page of the dashboard is done with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).  Navigational bars, drop-down menus, and tables all use Bootstrap components.
2.  CSS.  Images and component characteristics are modified with a CSS style sheet.
3.  The dashboard uses responsive web design to adjust the layout and image sizes based on the user's device.
